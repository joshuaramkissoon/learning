## Overview
React is a declarative JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called _components_. Components are used to tell React what we want to see on the screen and when our data changes, React efficiently updates and re-renders our components.

A component takes in parameters, called `props` short for "properties" and returns a hierarchy of views to dsiplay via the `render` method.
